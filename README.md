# A basic Neural Network
This project is a simple prototype that simulate the behavior of a neural network. 
This network permits to resolve the XOR operation, a simple problem that a perceptron (i.e. a network without an hidden layer) cannot resolve itself. 
The project is developed for Arduino UNO shield, so for an ATMega328 microcontroller.
